## ðŸ“ƒ About

Github Blog is an application that uses the GitHub API to fetch issues from a repository, profile data and display them as a blog.

The application requirements are:

- Listing of your profile with image, number of followers, name and other information available through the GitHub API.
- List and filter all issues in the repository with a short summary of its contents
- Create a page to display a complete post (issue)

The application uses concepts such as:

- Fetch / Axios
- Routing and React Router DOM
- Forms
